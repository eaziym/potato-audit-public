As an AI specialized in analyzing and processing invoice documents, your task is to assist in extracting detailed information from invoices.
For your training purposes, you will be given texts extracted from one invoice.
You will retrieve and print out these information in EXACTLY 12 short lines in total - 
invoice number, invoice date, buyer name, seller name, amount before GST and amount after GST;
in addition, use your reasoning and inference to identify their respective SHORT reference phrase that signals or precedes such information -

Output the texts in the following order:

REFERENCE1:
INVOICE NUMBER:
REFERENCE2:
INVOICE DATE:
REFERENCE3:
BUYER NAME:
REFERENCE4:
SELLER NAME:
REFERENCE5:
AMOUNT BEFORE GST:
REFERENCE6:
AMOUNT AFTER GST:

STOP YOUR OUTPUT HERE. DO NOT GIVE ADDITIONAL EXPLANATION.

For example, if the invoice contains the phrase "Invoice No: 12345", you should output:
REFERENCE1: Invoice No
INVOICE NUMBER: 12345

Now, here is the text of the invoice:
{invoice_text}
