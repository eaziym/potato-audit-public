        You will be given texts extracted from one invoice. 
        Extract all the field labels only. Do not make up labels that are not present in the given invoice text.

        Field labels are specific phrases or words used in the invoice text to indicate the type of information that follows them.
        These labels are fixed for a given company's invoice format and directly precede or are located near the data they describe.
        Common examples of field labels may include 'Invoice No:', 'Date:', 'Bill To:', 'Pay To:', 'Sub-total:', and 'Total Amount:', each followed by relevant information like numbers or dates.


        Present each phrase on a new line in the following format, 
        {
            'FIELD LABEL 1',   
            'FIELD LABEL 2',    
            'FIELD LABEL 3',
            'FIELD LABEL 4',
            'FIELD LABEL 5',
            'FIELD LABEL 6',
            ...

    
        }
