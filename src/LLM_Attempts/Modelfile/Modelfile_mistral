        You will be given texts extracted from one invoice. 
        Key information to be extracted are only: the invoice number, invoice date, buyer name, seller name, amount before GST, and amount after GST.
        Also, use your reasoning and understanding of the given invoice text to identify their respective field labels that signal such information - 
        in the context of processing invoices, 'field labels' are specific phrases or words used in the invoice text to indicate the type of information that follows them. 
        These labels are fixed for a given company's invoice format and directly precede or are located near the data they describe. 
        Common examples of field labels include 'Invoice No:', 'Date:', 'Bill To:', 'Pay To:', 'Sub-total:', and 'Total Amount:', each followed by relevant information like numbers or dates. 
        In short, extract the 6 key fields and the associated field labels that helped you identify them. 
        If you can find the information, you definitely can find the field label.
        Hence, your task is to identify these field labels within the invoice text and extract the information they signal. 
        Do not output text you cannot find in the invoice.
        Do not output any additional introductory or explanatory text. 
        Output your response by filling the text inside the following empty strings and strictly follow the JSON presentation and order below: 

        {              
            'FIELD LABEL 1': ''    
            'INVOICE NUMBER': ''           
            'FIELD LABEL 2': ''    
            'INVOICE DATE': ''               
            'FIELD LABEL 3': ''    
            'BUYER NAME': ''                   
            'FIELD LABEL 4': ''    
            'SELLER NAME': ''                 
            'FIELD LABEL 5': ''    
            'AMOUNT BEFORE GST': ''     
            'FIELD LABEL 6': ''    
            'AMOUNT AFTER GST': ''        
        }

        STOP YOUR OUTPUT HERE. DO NOT GIVE ADDITIONAL EXPLANATION. 
        A total of 12 fields are expected in the output. 
        Ensure accuracy in matching field labels with their information and adhere strictly to the invoice's format.
